This term was first introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw, Black feminist and legal scholar, in 1989, in her<i>“Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of
        Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory and Antiracist Politics”</i>  article. This article sheds light on the unfortunate gap women of color find themselves in, between antiracism laws and gender discrimination laws. Women of color’s issues are not the same as a white woman’s, the discrimination of gender is often accompanied with racial discrimination, creating a whole other world of obstacles. Since most laws back then allowed loopholes in which the discrimination of women of color was almost impossible to prove, the term “intersectionality” is adopted to urge people to consider the overlap in different kinds of discrimination, rather than viewing them as separate issues. This term does not only apply to race, it includes any kind of discrimination women face, whether that is class, social status, ethnicity, nationality, language, sexuality etc.
